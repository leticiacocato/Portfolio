# 📊 Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Science Portfolio** – a curated showcase of my work, projects, technical skills, and experience. This repository is intended to demonstrate my capabilities in data analysis, visualization and building data-driven applications.

## Featured Projects

### 🗺️ Geodata Dashboard: Singapore HDB Resale Prices

An interactive dashboard built using **R Shiny** to visualize and explore **Singapore's HDB resale price trends** across time and space.

🔗 **Live App**: [Click to Launch](https://leticiacocato.shinyapps.io/geodata_project/)  

#### Key Features:
- Interactive map showing resale prices by town, area across time periods.
